# Word Whiz

[Word Whiz](https://go1den.github.io/wordwhiz) is based on popular word scramble games like Word Whomp and Text Twist.  
Try to unscramble all of the words in the time limit.  
You can use your keyboard or mouse to play.

The word list being used is not my own.  
It is in the public domain.  
There may be inappropriate words as a result.  

If you find any, [please report them to me on this Github](https://github.com/Go1den/wordwhiz/issues) and I will remove them.

# How to Play

Try to make as many words as you can using the provided letters before the time runs out. If you score the points needed to advance, you will move on to another round with a harder threshold. Make it all the way to round 8 and the timer will reduce to just 2 minutes. How high of a score can you get?
